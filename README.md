## Laravel Developer For SlickText API Integration

https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~01cd01ec4fd240bcdb

I would like my laravel application to have a function that can add and remove phone numbers from my contacts list on slick text (https://www.slicktext.com).

This function will accept a name, email address, phone number and action (add or remove) return back with true or false based on a successful action.

This function will be used and integrated by myself (I am a full stack developer). I don't have the time to work with or learn their api at the moment. Please put your favorite color as the first line in your proposal.

I am using Laravel 10 and PHP 8. You will need to create a free account to get api keys.
